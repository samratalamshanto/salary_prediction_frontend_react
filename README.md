# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning Models
1. Firstly, I Trained the model using the StackOverflow public dataset. 
2. Then the endpoints were exposed using FastAPI to predict salary based on the trained model. 
3. Lastly, I created a User Interface using React and deployed it to the live server using Docker image.

## Live URLS:
  1. **Fast API Backend Service URL**: https://machine-leaning-salary-prediction-fast.onrender.com/

  2. **Frontend React URL**: https://salary-prediction-frontend-react-new.onrender.com/

## Key Points:
1. Machine Learning Model Trained using Public Dataset.
2. FastAPI for creating endpoints for predicting salary using a trained model.
3. React is used to create a user interface.
4. Create a Docker image for both the backend and frontend.
